Today we learned how to create local storage in a web application. It confuses me that data in a session is stored in the file system (per the quiz due today). However, this wouldn't be programming if the concepts weren't so abstract.

Dreading tomorrow.  Today's lab went fast thanks to Austin's help.  He's pretty good with this stuff.
