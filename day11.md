Today I learned how to set up a randomized click tracker.  The javascript displays three random images, prompting a user to selected one of the three images they like best.  After the 25th click, the program ends and a statistical report is generated detailing how many clicks each photo received.  It also includes photos that were not selected.

Today I had a regularly-scheduled student conference with our instructor Sam.  He thinks I'm doing well in the class and didn't have much to add to what I'm already doing in the class.  Sam's teaching style suits me well.  I stated my desire to move into the 301 class that begins on July 10 and he took me over to meet Scott Schmidt, my prospective 301 instructor.  I'm kind of excited at the prospect of moving on to 301.  I imagine the anticipation will grow as July 10 approaches.
