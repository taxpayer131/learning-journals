Today we went much deeper into rendering our table/form into HTML using DOM manipulation using javascript.  Today's code review consisted mainly of reviewing yesterday's stretch goals in class.  This afternoon was spent styling our cookie_stand HTML.

I'm a little burned out.  A month and a half of Code 201 is wearing me out.  It's been a hard week.
