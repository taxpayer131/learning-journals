Today is a welcome sight.  I'm doing much better, grade-wise, at this halfway mark of the class than I was doing last month.  I've learned to persevere and ask for help in getting my assignments completed and submitted on time.  I've adopted the George Costanza approach to making decisions about how to spend my free time in class and "do the opposite" of whatever decision I want to execute.  This has resulted in me being more efficient with my time.
