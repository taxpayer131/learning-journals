We're in the homestretch for project week.  We hit our MVP early this afternoon which means our app has all the functionality we planned.  It's pretty exciting.  At this point we're just going to begin adjusting the CSS and put it through extensive testing.  We still have to write up the documentation in the README file, too, but I started it today.  I hope to be done with it tomorrow after consulting with the rest of the team.
