Project presentation day!  Isaac and I spent thirty minutes this morning migrating our app's site page over to a new domain - repong.win.  The site is up and running now.  The downside is all the simulation games Austin ran last night to populate the leaderboard were lost in the transfer between domains.  Right now Isaac and I are relaxing in the campus space while Austin and Kimmer are trying to get the far stretch goal of implementing the nemesis functionality.
